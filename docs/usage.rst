Algorithm walkthrough
---------------------

Let's walk through the algorithm behind the default ``Unrasterizer`` class. The basic use pattern is as follows: ::

    u = Unrasterizer(mask_width=4, threshold=0.5)
    representative_points = u.select_representative_pixels(raster_data)

``mask_width`` indicates minimum number of non-selected pixels between adjacent selected pixels.

``threshold`` indicates the minimum value required for a pixel to be selected. Measured in the same units as value (often population per pixel).

``agg`` indicates how the original pixel values from the raster should be aggregated. It can be either ``sum`` or ``average``. In the case of something like population, we would want to ``sum`` to preserve the original total population. With rainfall data, however, we might seek to obtain the ``average`` for a given area.

First, all pixels with value below the given threshold will be ignored. The remaining pixels are sorted according to their values and considered for selection one by one.

After each point is selected, all points within a circle of radius ``mask_width`` in the :math:`L^\infty` norm (i.e., a square in the standard Euclidean norm) of the newly chosen point are masked and removed from further consideration. This process continues until every point is either selected or part of the mask.

The ``Unrasterizer`` class performs this selection process on the entire raster file, while the ``WindowedUnrasterizer`` applies the same process across each individual raster block and combines the results into a single array of selected pixels.

Demonstration

Here, the initial red triangle in the west represents pixels that fall below the population threshold. This could represent an uninhabited geographical feature, like a mountainside or part of a lake.

The initial purple pixel indicates the pixel with the highest value. It is chosen first.

All points within a square of radius ``mask_width`` of the chosen pixel are added to the mask (moving from turquoise to orange to red). These points will never be selected going forward.

Next, the remaining (turquoise) pixel with the highest value is selected and the pixels around it are masked. This process repeats ad infinitum.
